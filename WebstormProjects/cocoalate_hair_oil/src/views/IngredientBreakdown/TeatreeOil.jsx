                <span>4. Promotes Hair Growth:</span> Tea tree oil stimulates blood circulation to the scalp, which can help promote hair growth. It nourishes the hair follicles and encourages the growth of stronger, healthier hair.

                <span>5. Prevents Hair Loss:</span> By strengthening the hair follicles and reducing breakage, tea tree oil can help prevent hair loss and promote thicker, fuller hair growth. It improves the overall health and vitality of the hair, making it less prone to damage and shedding.
                <br/>

                <span>6. Reduces Scalp Oiliness:</span> Tea tree oil helps regulate sebum production on the scalp, making it beneficial for individuals with oily scalp conditions. It helps balance oil levels, preventing the scalp from becoming too greasy or oily.
                <br/>

                <span>7. Adds Shine and Luster:</span> Tea tree oil can impart a natural shine and luster to the hair, making it look healthy and vibrant. It smooths the hair cuticle, reducing frizz and flyaways, and enhancing the overall appearance of the hair.
