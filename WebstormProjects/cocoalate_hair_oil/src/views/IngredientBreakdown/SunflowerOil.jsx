                <br/>

                <span>3. Protects Against Damage:</span> Sunflower oil contains antioxidants, such as vitamin E, that help protect the hair from environmental damage, such as UV radiation and pollution. It forms a protective barrier on the hair shaft, shielding it from external stressors.
