                Preparation:

                Before using the hair growth oil, ensure that your hair and scalp are clean and free from any styling products or buildup. You can wash your hair with a gentle shampoo and towel dry it lightly.
                Application:

                Shake the bottle of hair growth oil well to ensure all ingredients are evenly mixed.
                Using the dropper provided or your fingertips, apply a small amount of oil directly onto your scalp.
                Part your hair into sections to ensure even distribution of the oil.
                Gently massage the oil into your scalp using circular motions for 5-10 minutes to promote blood circulation and stimulate hair follicles.
                If desired, apply a small amount of oil to the lengths and ends of your hair for added nourishment and shine.
                Leave-In Treatment:

                After massaging the oil into your scalp and hair, leave it in overnight for maximum absorption and benefits.
                For a more intensive treatment, cover your hair with a shower cap or wrap it in a warm towel to help the oil penetrate deeply into the hair shaft.
                Washing Out:

                In the morning, wash your hair thoroughly with a gentle shampoo to remove any excess oil.
                Follow up with conditioner as usual to keep your hair soft and manageable.
                Frequency:

                For best results, use the hair growth oil 2-3 times per week as part of your regular hair care routine.
                Consistency is key, so continue using the oil regularly to see visible improvements in hair growth and health over time.
                Caution:

                Avoid contact with eyes. If contact occurs, rinse thoroughly with water.
                Perform a patch test before using the oil to check for any allergic reactions or skin sensitivities.
                Discontinue use if irritation occurs and consult a healthcare professional if necessary.
                Storage:

                Store the hair growth oil in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
                Keep the bottle tightly closed when not in use to prevent oxidation and maintain the quality of the oil.
                Disclaimer:

                This hair growth oil is intended for external use only. Avoid ingestion and keep out of reach of children.
